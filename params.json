Another narcotics loving programmer in the security sector who hath decided to grace the public scene with his presence and wit.\r\n\r\nYou may follow me on the twitters at [@packetforger](https://twitter.com/packetforger), and check out my repos here. Be warned, they are kind of crap.\r\n\r\nThis page will be used to discuss all sorts of things from IT Security, programming and music, to psychology, sociology, and science. It may also offend you, and should be considered NSFW.\r\n\r\n### $ ls /projects\r\nCurrently I am working on a number of projects, most of them forks of pre-existing stuff because there is no point whatsoever in reinventing the wheel, and it simply feels better to contribute to a greater project sometimes.\r\n\r\n* [AndroRAT](https://github.com/packetforger/androrat): An Android Remote Administration Tool (RAT), actually a fork of a pre-existing project, modified somewhat to install silently with a preconfigured C&C host/port.\r\n\r\n* [DoFler](https://github.com/packetforger/DoFler): A wonderful \"Wall of Sheep\" esque project by the inestimable @SteveMcGrath that I simply fell in love with and decided I *had* to maintain for fun. Going to be (trying) to implement more parsers to it for stuff like FTP credentials, etc.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
